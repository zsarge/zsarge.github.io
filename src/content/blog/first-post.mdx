I think about these XKCD comics a lot:

<div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <ZoomImage
      imageProps={{
        height: "300",
        width: "300",
        alt: "Don't forget the time you spend finding the chart to look up what you save. And the time spent reading this reminder about the time spent. And the time trying to figure out if either of those actually make sense. Remember, every second counts toward your life total, including these right now.",

      }}

  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <ZoomImage
      imageProps={{
        height: "300",
        width: "300",
        alt: "'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'",

## TODO - Story so far

## Is it worth it?

So, now's the time to figure out if it's actually worth it.
