I think about these XKCD comics a lot:

<div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <ZoomImage
      imageProps={{
        height: "300",
        width: "300",
        alt: "Don't forget the time you spend finding the chart to look up what you save. And the time spent reading this reminder about the time spent. And the time trying to figure out if either of those actually make sense. Remember, every second counts toward your life total, including these right now.",

## Is it worth it?

So, this prompts the question: Was it actually worth it?

Let's analyze the project, and see if it saved me time.

The rules are:

1. The cat feeder saves me time when it dispenses food.
1. The cat feeder wastes time when I have to go fix it.

$$
\therefore
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Time Spent} = & \text{ time spent near cat feeder} &\\
+ & \text{ time working on design and construction}
\end{align}
$$

And, for every successful time that food is dispensed:

$$
\text{Time Saved} = \begin{cases}
    30 \text{ minutes} & \text{when I'm in my dorm}\\
    \text{driving duration}                     & \text{when I'm} \gt \text{1,000m away}
\end{cases}
$$

The following calendar illustrates how many minutes each day this project <span class="text-red-400">took</span>, and how much it <span class="text-green-400">saved</span>.

<CatFeederCalendar client:load />

TODO: graph with time spent per day and time wasted per day, and then the sum of both as a sparkline

<TotalMinutesWasted />
