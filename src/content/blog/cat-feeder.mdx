## Introduction

There are a bunch of adorable kitties living in the bushes at [NKU](https://www.nku.edu/).

For much of the semester, a smattering of students and staff have been taking care of the cats.
They serve daily meals, and have created small houses for the cats to live in.

However, feeding the kitties on a regular basis requires a signficant time commitment.
Additionally, we knew that nobody would be on campus over winter break to feed the kitties.

So, my friends and I built an automatic cat feeder, robust enough to survive abuse by the
wildlife and even the most severe snow storms.

### Context

Here are the cats we are taking care of:

<CatPictures />

You might notice that some of the cats aren't actually cats. We'll get to that later.

Here is the area we were working with. The cats love to hang out in the bushes, and they wander around the courtyard area throughout the day.

  panorama="/assets/cat-feeder/PXL_20241213_211110965.PANO.jpg"
  options={{ pitch: -15, yaw: 88, hfov: 65 }}
/>

Note that there's only one outlet in the area, so we're limited on where we can put the cat feeder.

In the end, we made a cat feeder:

import CatFeeder from "/src/assets/cat-feeder/CatFeeder.png";

<ZoomOptimized
  src={CatFeeder}
  alt="A cat feeder made with a yellow bucket, a silver bucket, and an umbrella"
/>

And we made a camera to record it:

import Camera from "/src/assets/cat-feeder/Camera.jpg";

<ZoomOptimized
  src={Camera}
  alt="A cat feeder made with a yellow bucket, a silver bucket, and an umbrella"
  width="300"
/>

## Initial Development

### Grace's Design

Grace had been feeding the cats by hand for several weeks at this point.

When we talked about creating an automatic cat feeder, she created an amazing artistic representation of our goals:

import GraceDrawing from "/src/assets/cat-feeder/GraceDrawing.png";

<ZoomOptimized
  src={GraceDrawing}
  alt="Grace's diagram of a cat feeder"
  className="text-center"
  height="600"
/>

This illustrates the core functionality:

- Lots of food goes in the top
- A bit of food goes into food bowls at regular intervals

Originally, we wanted to have multiple food bowls, so that the cats don't get in each others' way,
but we ended up only having one bowl for simplicity.
We also never got around to building the housing for the cats, partially due to cost reasons.

### Research

Initially, I wanted to do this project using only the tools available in the club room.

Given that we were going through renovations, my focus was largely limited to what I could build using
solely 3d-printed components, and some motors intended for educational use.

We started out by doing some research on cat feeders.

For one, [we took a look on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Outdoor+cat+feeder), and found that it's possible to buy an indoor automatic cat feeder,
and it's possible to buy outdoor feeding stations for cats, but we did not find many good options for true outdoor cat feeders.

We started looking into blog posts about this. We found
this great [Russian blog post](https://alexgyver.ru/gyverfeed2/) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AlexGyver/GyverFeed2)
about building a cat feeder, which released [the feeder screw](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4753380) for free.

In their project, they only 3d-printed the screw and used PVC pipe as the outer housing.

In our case, we have a lot of free filament, so we decided to 3d print the pipe as well to save costs.

### First Auger

This led us to our first design:

<AnnotatedStl client:load url="/assets/cat-feeder/version1.stl" name="Initial Auger Design" />

In this case, we started with this prototype just to make sure food would come out:

import InitialDesign from "/src/assets/cat-feeder/InitialDesign.jpg";

<ZoomOptimized src={InitialDesign} alt="A circuit as defined below" width="500" />

This was some of the first 3d-modelling I've ever done. I was using [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), as it was recommended for beginners.
I found it to be quite approachable, although it certainly was not as powerful as something like [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/en/)
(which also runs in the browser and is free for students!).

Through this initial prototype, I learned:

1. The auger is effective at distributing dry cat food!
2. It's important to leave good tolerances. (The auger was too close to the pipe.)

We had a circuit that cut power to the
[28BYJ48 motor and ULN2003AN driver board](https://lastminuteengineers.com/28byj48-stepper-motor-arduino-tutorial/)
when it is not in use, to minimize overheating.

import Circuit from "/src/assets/cat-feeder/Circuit.jpg";

<ZoomOptimized src={Circuit} alt="A circuit as defined below" width="600" />

This uses a IRFZ44N N-Channel mosfet:

- **Gate:** Pin 2 on esp32
- **Drain:** Goes to the negative line on the ULN2003AN
- **Source:** Goes to the negative line for the 9V power supply
- **Note:** make sure to include a ~10KÎ© resistor between the gate and the source.

Toby found [this interesting article](https://everythingsmarthome.co.uk/converting-the-28byj-48-stepper-motor-for-more-torque/) which detailed how to modify the stepper motor for more torque.

But, this all ended up being in vain, as the force from our little motor
was nowhere near enough to overpower the cat food when little pellets get stuck between the auger and pipe.

### Rotisserie Chicken Motor

Enter: A rotisserie chicken motor!

It's been sitting in my basement for years.

| **Value** | **Property**           |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| 3         | Revolutions Per Minute |
| 11.5      | Newton-metres          |
| 120       | Volts (AC)             |

This motor is going to be strong enough!

I think about these XKCD comics a lot:

## TODO - Story so far

<QuoteBlock>test</QuoteBlock>

## Is it worth it?

So, this prompts the question: Was it actually worth it?

Let's analyze the project, and see if it saved me time.

The rules are:

1. The cat feeder saves me time when it dispenses food.
1. The cat feeder wastes time when I have to go fix it.

$$
\therefore
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Time Spent} = & \text{ time spent near cat feeder} &\\
+ & \text{ time working on design and construction}
\end{align}
$$

And, for every successful time that food is dispensed:

$$
\text{Time Saved} = \begin{cases}
    30 \text{ minutes} & \text{when I'm in my dorm}\\
    \text{driving duration}                     & \text{when I'm} \gt \text{1,000m away}
\end{cases}
$$

The following calendar illustrates how many minutes each day this project <span class="text-red-400">took</span>, and how much it <span class="text-green-400">saved</span>.

Fun facts that I've been told:

- Tortishells and Calicos are female
- Orange Tabby is usually male
