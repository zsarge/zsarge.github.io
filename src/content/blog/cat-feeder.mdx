## Introduction

There are a bunch of adorable kitties living in the bushes at [NKU](https://www.nku.edu/).

For much of the semester, a smattering of students and staff have been taking care of the cats.
They serve daily meals, and have created small houses for the cats to live in.

However, feeding the kitties on a regular basis requires a signficant time commitment.
Additionally, we knew that nobody would be on campus over winter break to feed the kitties.

So, my friends and I built an automatic cat feeder, robust enough to survive abuse by the
wildlife and even the most severe snow storms.

### Context

Here are the cats we are taking care of:

<CatPictures />

You might notice that some of the cats aren't actually cats. We'll get to that later.

Here is the area we were working with. The cats love to hang out in the bushes, and they wander around the courtyard area throughout the day.

<PanellumViewer
  panorama="/assets/cat-feeder/PXL_20241213_211110965.PANO.jpg"
  options={{ pitch: -15, yaw: 88, hfov: 65 }}
/>

Note that there's only one outlet in the area, so we're limited on where we can put the cat feeder.

In the end, we made a cat feeder:

import CatFeeder from "/src/assets/cat-feeder/CatFeeder.png";

<ZoomOptimized
  src={CatFeeder}
  alt="A cat feeder made with a yellow bucket, a silver bucket, and an umbrella"
/>

And we made a camera to record it:

import Camera from "/src/assets/cat-feeder/Camera.jpg";

<ZoomOptimized
  src={Camera}
  alt="A cat feeder made with a yellow bucket, a silver bucket, and an umbrella"
  width="300"
/>

## Initial Development

Initially, I wanted to do this project using only the tools available in the club room.

Given that we were going through renovations, my focus was largely limited to what I could build using solely 3d-printed components, and some motors intended for educational use.

I think about these XKCD comics a lot:

And the time trying to figure out if either of those actually make sense. Remember, every second counts toward your life total, including these right now.",

## TODO - Story so far

## Is it worth it?

So, this prompts the question: Was it actually worth it?

Let's analyze the project, and see if it saved me time.

The rules are:

1. The cat feeder saves me time when it dispenses food.
1. The cat feeder wastes time when I have to go fix it.

$$
\therefore
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Time Spent} = & \text{ time spent near cat feeder} &\\
+ & \text{ time working on design and construction}
\end{align}
$$

And, for every successful time that food is dispensed:

$$
\text{Time Saved} = \begin{cases}
    30 \text{ minutes} & \text{when I'm in my dorm}\\
    \text{driving duration}                     & \text{when I'm} \gt \text{1,000m away}
\end{cases}
$$

The following calendar illustrates how many minutes each day this project <span class="text-red-400">took</span>, and how much it <span class="text-green-400">saved</span>.
