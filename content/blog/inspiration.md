## Code Inspiration

Originally, when I first thought about creating a blog, I started creating a prototype in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), using the static site generator [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/). I figured that, because Gridsome takes care of a lot of the difficulties of static site generation, I would find the experience more enjoyable, and I would be able to quickly create a quality website.

I still genuinely believe Gridsome + Vue is a very powerfull option when it comes to static site generation, but I quickly found that once the codebase grew larger than what I could comfortably hold in my head, I stopped enjoying working on the site as much, and for a personal site that I'm doing for fun, that effectively killed the project for me.

Later, in a brief fascination with React, I tried to get a basic page started in a similar fashion, yet lost interest again.

In the end, what really prompted me to make a blog was stumbling across Brad Taunt's project [**B**logs **A**re **R**eally **F**un ('barf')](https://git.sr.ht/~bt/barf). barf is a fork of Karl Bartel's original [blog.sh](https://github.com/karlb/karl.berlin), both of which aim to create a static blog with an extrememly minimal code base. Finding these projects was a moment of clarity for me, as I realized that, at its core, creating a blog is about finding a way to express your thoughts and ideas with others, and it doesn't need to be through a blazing fast ðŸš€ðŸš€ state-of-the-art âœ¨âœ¨ single page jamstack webapp. I was overcomplicating it.

So, slapped together a quick Ruby script, heavily reliant on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), to convert markdown articles into a website. It may not be "quality code", and it's certianly longer than both blog.sh and barf, but it's still short enough for me to enjoy working with it, and that's what matters to me.

## Formatting Inspiration

When designing the actual look of the site, I drew heavily from [orlp.net](https://orlp.net/). I really like his code blocks, and overall aesthetic.

I also yoinked the blogroll format from [perfectionkills.com](http://perfectionkills.com/).
