Hi! I'm Zack. I'm 19, and the internet entertainment landscape I've grown up with is fundamentally unsustainable.

In this post, I want to break down what the internet means to me, and recognize what is sustainable, and what is too good to be true.

# Baby's First Entertainment

Much of the media I was exposed to as a child was from the '90s. I was born in 2004, just in time to ride the wave of VHS tapes of Fraggle Rock, Land Before Time, and old Disney movies.

As a kid, I loved the worlds of Rick Riordan and Lemony Snicket. I spent countless hours immersed in fantasy worlds,
and I remember the first Scholastic Book Fair where I was so excited to buy new books that I was interested in.

This is my reference point for what I think of as "Entertainment as a Unit", and I want to contrast it to social media being "Entertainment as a Platform".

When entertainment is packaged into titles and sold individually, the unit economics make sense. This is a tried and true technique.
It is worthwhile to invest in telling a compelling story, or packaging good information,
because people will pay a preimum for it.

# Enter: The Internet

My first memories of the internet do not involve social media, not yet.
It took me a moment to figure out the whole "language" thing, so pardon me for not filling out my Facebook profile.

My first memories of entertinament on the internet involve looking over my parent's shoulder as they browsed indivdual webpages.

In a land before recommendation algorithms (circa 2009), compilations of curated links were especially valuable in navigating internet content.

Consider the link curator Dark Rosted Blend, for example: If you were bored on the internet, you could visit a page [like this](http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2009/05/link-latte-112.html) and find a variety of hyperlinks to funny, weird, or interesting things.

This is a nice snapshot of the variety of media that exists on the internet at this time.

We have text, images, and video.

YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo are still duking it out in video hosting.

Individual blogs exist alongside a smattering of startups and large companies making the transition from print media.

[4chan](https://4chan.org/) invents image macros of cats captioned in impact font, and [I Can Has Cheezburger?](https://icanhas.cheezburger.com/) brings them into the mainstream. The world will never be the same. [^1]

We also get to see the [Blogosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere) in its hayday. Blogs are everywhere.
There's personal blogs from people who are sharing their thoughts, ideas, and funny things from their life.
There's topic blogs from people dedicated to a specific theme or idea, like [CakeWrecks](https://www.cakewrecks.com/) (est. 2008), dedicated to Bad Cakes of all shapes and sizes.

As a child, I used to love the humor blog "Hyperbole And A Half" by Allie Brosh because she [had silly drawings](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/03/7-games-you-can-play-with-brick.html), and I remember how difficult it was to remember her blog name so that I could search for it.

[Her blog post from 2009](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2009/12/stabbing-and-on-scale-of-one-to-10-its.html)
about how how difficult it was to explain that she was a "blogger" shows how
bloggers existed, but were certianly not widely accepted as a profession.

**But where's the money?**

1. Mainly, ads.

Google AdMob quickly esatablished itself as the standard for distributing banner ads across the internet,
and, combined with its ownership of Blogger, monitized the early internet selling mostly unobtrusive banner ads.
The assumption seemed to be that content should be viewable for free, without an account, and that banner ads would be chosen based on the content in the blog.

2. Additonally, books and merchandise.

My family bought books from [CakeWrecks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0740785370) (2009) and [HyperboleAndAHalf](https://hyperboleandahalfbook.blogspot.com/) (2013). I remember really enjoying them as a kid.

Diversifying a brand's income through T-Shirts, goods, and other forms of media is a part of the influencer playbook that still exists to this day.

But, this was really my parent's internet. It was not made for me

3. Nowhere.

Many sites are created and run by people who enjoy sharing with others for little profit, or at a loss.
For many individuals, monetization is neither an option, nor a priority.
To them, sharing with others is inherently rewarding, and

**Is this sustianable?**

Well, luckily
