Are you in charge of a hacking club at your university? Are you looking for information about CTFs, hacking, and cyber security? Here's my advice.

## Resources

### CTF Time

- https://ctftime.org/calendar/

**If you're skimming this article, look at this calendar.** This is the most time sensitive part

When running a club, it's always great to join free events hosted by professionals, but you don't want them to sneak up on you. Look at this calendar early, and add interesting events to your calendar *now*.



**TODO:** Review how all the events we've done this year went

- SSH Tetris
- Bandit Box
- OWASP Juice Shop
- OWASP PyGoat
- Square CTF

**TODO: ** paste all the links I've shared in Discord



**TODO** add section at the end about configuring recurring events in CampusGroups and scheduling emails
