<h2 id="about-the-cve">About the CVE</h2>
<p>We will be asking these chatbots about <a
href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29143">CVE-2020-29143</a>.</p>
<p>From the CVE page, this exploit is described as:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>A SQL injection vulnerability in
<code>interface/reports/non_reported.php</code> in OpenEMR before
5.0.2.5 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the <code>form_code</code> parameter.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="chatbot-responses">Chatbot responses</h2>
<blockquote class="human">
Can you tell me about CVE-2020-29143?
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="chatgpt">
<p><span class="chatgpt-title">ChatGPT</span></p>
<p>Sure, CVE-2020-29143 is a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
ID that was assigned to a vulnerability that affects multiple products
and platforms that use the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>The vulnerability was discovered in November 2020 and was publicly
disclosed in December 2020. It was rated as a high severity
vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.8.</p>
<p>The vulnerability exists in the kernel’s implementation of the
Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF), a feature that allows programs to filter
network packets as they are received or sent. An attacker can exploit
this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network packet to a
vulnerable system, which can then trigger a buffer overflow and allow
the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.</p>
<p>The vulnerability affects a wide range of Linux distributions and
products, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
and others. Vendors have released patches to address the vulnerability,
and it is recommended that affected systems are updated as soon as
possible to prevent exploitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that’s just not true at all. This CVE does not has nothing to
do with the Linux Kernel. All of ChatGPT’s information about how this
vulnerability targets the kernel’s packet filter is completely made up.
However, Bard and Bing are both intended to help much more with this
type of factual search, so let’s see how they fare.</p>
<blockquote class="bard">
<p><span class="bard-title">Bard</span></p>
<p>CVE-2020-29143 is a SQL injection vulnerability in OpenEMR before
5.0.2.5. This vulnerability allows a remote authenticated attacker to
execute arbitrary SQL commands via the form_code parameter.</p>
<p>The vulnerability exists in the way that OpenEMR handles the
form_code parameter in the interface/reports/non_reported.php file. When
a user submits a report, the form_code parameter is used to identify the
report. However, the parameter is not properly sanitized, which allows
an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.</p>
<p>If an attacker is able to exploit this vulnerability, they could
execute arbitrary SQL commands on the affected system. This could allow
them to steal data, modify data, or even take control of the system.</p>
<p>The vulnerability was discovered by and reported to OpenEMR by
security researcher Orange Tsai of DEVCORE. OpenEMR has released a patch
for the vulnerability, which is available in version 5.0.2.5.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be able to
submit a report to OpenEMR. This could be done by visiting the OpenEMR
website and submitting a report, or by sending a malicious email to a
user who is authorized to submit reports.</p>
<p>Once the attacker has submitted a report, they would need to include
a specially crafted form_code parameter in the report. The form_code
parameter would need to contain SQL commands that the attacker wants to
execute.</p>
<p>If the attacker is successful in exploiting this vulnerability, they
could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the affected system. This could
allow them to steal data, modify data, or even take control of the
system.</p>
<p>To protect against this vulnerability, users should upgrade to
OpenEMR version 5.0.2.5 or later. If users are unable to upgrade, they
should disable the ability to submit reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinon, Bard does a great job summarizing the information on
the CVE page. As ChatGPT training data cuts off in in September 2021,
this CVE from 2020 should still be fair game. However, it may not have
been included directly, so ChatGPT may be more inclined to engage in
speculation based on general knowledge of CVEs, rather than knowledge of
this specific example. Bard, on the other hand, constantly pulls
information from the the entire web, and is much better for factual
searches.</p>
<aside>
<p>However, this does not guarantee that Bard’s information is accurate.
In one entertaining instance, Google Bard used a 6-hour-old internet
comment to “prove” that Google Bard was shutting down.</p>

and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35255864">Hacker
News</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>But anyway, based on my understanding, this is an accurate summary of
this CVE.</p>
<blockquote class="bing">
<p><span class="bing-title">Bing (Precise)</span></p>
<p>CVE-2020-29143 is a <strong>SQL injection vulnerability</strong> in
interface/reports/non_reported.php in <strong>OpenEMR</strong> before

<p>Bing provides a very limited summary, and focuses on mostly providing
links to other sources. But, I like it; it’s short and helpful for those
looking for a quick overview.</p>
<blockquote class="human">
How can I protect against it?
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve gotten so used to using pronouns with these chatbots, but the
fact that I can effortlessly use “it” and have the context be properly
understood should not be taken for granted.</p>
<blockquote class="chatgpt">
<p><span class="chatgpt-title">ChatGPT</span></p>
<p>The best way to protect against CVE-2020-29143 is to ensure that your
system is updated with the latest security patches. Most Linux
distributions and products have released patches to address this
vulnerability, so it is recommended that you install the latest updates
as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to applying patches, you can also take the following
steps to reduce the risk of exploitation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Implement strict network security policies: Restricting network
access to trusted sources and implementing strict firewall rules can
help prevent attackers from exploiting the vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit user privileges: Limiting user privileges to only what is
necessary can help reduce the impact of a successful attack.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor for signs of exploitation: Regularly monitoring system
logs and network traffic for unusual activity can help detect signs of
exploitation.</p></li>
<li><p>Use intrusion detection and prevention systems: Intrusion
detection and prevention systems can help identify and block attacks
targeting the vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider implementing exploit mitigation techniques: Some Linux
distributions and products offer exploit mitigation techniques such as
address space layout randomization (ASLR) and stack smashing protection
(SSP), which can help make it more difficult for attackers to
successfully exploit the vulnerability.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again, ChatGPT is just hallucinating here. It’s technically true
that updating is important to addressing this CVE, but ChatGPT continues
to reuse its previous guess that this was a vulnerability relating to
the Linux Kernel.</p>
<blockquote class="bard">
<p><span class="bard-title">Bard</span></p>
<p>To protect against CVE-2020-29143, you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to OpenEMR version 5.0.2.5 or later.</li>
<li>If you are unable to upgrade, disable the ability to submit
reports.</li>
<li>Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block SQL injection
attacks.</li>
<li>Keep your software up to date with the latest security patches.</li>
<li>Implement strong passwords and change them regularly.</li>
<li>Use two-factor authentication whenever possible.</li>
<li>Educate your users about security best practices.</li>
<li>Monitor your system for suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Have a plan in place to respond to a security breach.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very impressive breakdown of the best steps to address this
CVE.</p>
<p>The first two bullet points are great: it gets the version number
correct, and correctly identifies the simplest way to address the issue
while also anticipating other courses of action if updates are not
possible.</p>
<p>Using a web application firewall seems like a reasonable option to
address SQL injections, although it may be considerably more involved
than the other bullet points.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the rest of Bard’s advice is just general cybersecurity
recommendations, but they are still good to hear in comparison to
ChatGPT’s derranged ramblings.</p>
<blockquote class="bing">
<p><span class="bing-title">Bing (Precise)</span></p>
<p>One way to protect against this vulnerability is to update OpenEMR to
a version that is 5.0.2.5 or later. This should fix the vulnerability
and prevent attackers from exploiting it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again, Bing is the shortest and most succinct. It’s correct, and
relevant in this instance, so I can’t ask for too much more than
that.</p>
<p>Compared to Bard, I’m honestly not sure which answer I prefer.</p>
<p>As a standalone, I like Bard’s answer more as it’s more
comprehensive, but, as part of a chatting experience, I find that Bing’s
succinct responses are more easy to work with, as it is possible for the
user to ask for more information when necessary.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, while ChatGPT can sometimes provide accurate
information, it is also succeptible to complete and confident
hallucination.</p>
<p>In comparison, Bard and Bing chat do a much better job of providing
accurate information synthesized from multiple sources.</p>
<p>However, in the bigger picture, it is important to remember that none
of these chatbots are close to perfect, and should not be completely
trusted.</p>
<p>As with <a href="/blog/chatbot-comparison.html">my last
comparison</a>, Bing is my personal favorite. This time, I think that
Bard had a promising showing, and it’s clear that ChatGPT performed the
worst.</p>
<p>It will be very interesting to continue to follow these chatbots as
they grow and develop, and see if it is possible to consistently extract
accurate information from a Large Language Model. After all, there’s no
algorithm for truth.</p>
